SINGA supports distributed data parallel training and evaulation process based on multiprocessing. The following is the illustration of the data parallel training:

![MPI.png](attachment:MPI.png)

In the distributed training, each process runs a training script which utilizes one GPU. Each process has an individual rank, which gives information of which GPU the individual process is using. The training data is partitioned, so that each process can evaluate the sub-gradient based on the partitioned training data. Once the sub-graident is calculated on each processes, the overall stochastic gradient is obtained by all-reducing the sub-gradients evaluated by all processes. The all-reduce operation is supported by the NVidia Collective Communication Library (NCCL).

The all-reduce operation by NCCL can be used to reduce and synchronize the parameters from different GPUs. Let's consider a data partitioned distributed training using 4 GPUs. Once the sub-gradients from the 4 GPUs are calculated, the NCCL can perform the all-reduce process so that all the GPUs can get the sum of the sub-gradients over the GPUs:

Finally, the parameter update of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) can then be performed by using the overall stochastic gradient obtained by the all-reduce process.

## Instruction to Use:

SINGA supports two ways to launch the distributed training, namely I. MPI (Message Passing Interface) and II. python multiprocessing.

### I. Using MPI

The following are the detailed steps to start up a distributed training with MPI, using MNIST dataset as an example:

1. Import SINGA and Miscellaneous Libraries used for the training


```python
from singa import singa_wrap as singa
from singa import autograd
from singa import tensor
from singa import device
from singa import opt
import numpy as np
import os
import sys
import gzip
import codecs
import time
import urllib.request
```

2. Create a Convolutional Neural Network Model


```python
class CNN:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conv1 = autograd.Conv2d(1, 20, 5, padding=0)
        self.conv2 = autograd.Conv2d(20, 50, 5, padding=0)
        self.linear1 = autograd.Linear(4 * 4 * 50, 500)
        self.linear2 = autograd.Linear(500, 10)
        self.pooling1 = autograd.MaxPool2d(2, 2, padding=0)
        self.pooling2 = autograd.MaxPool2d(2, 2, padding=0)

    def forward(self, x):
        y = self.conv1(x)
        y = autograd.relu(y)
        y = self.pooling1(y)
        y = self.conv2(y)
        y = autograd.relu(y)
        y = self.pooling2(y)
        y = autograd.flatten(y)
        y = self.linear1(y)
        y = autograd.relu(y)
        y = self.linear2(y)
        return y

# create model
model = CNN()
```

3. Create a Distributed Optimizer Object and Device Assignment


```python
sgd = opt.SGD(lr=0.005, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=1e-5)
sgd = opt.DistOpt(sgd)
dev = device.create_cuda_gpu_on(sgd.rank_in_local)
```

4. Prepare the Training and Evaluation Data


```python
def load_dataset():
    train_x_url = 'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz'
    train_y_url = 'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz'
    valid_x_url = 'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz'
    valid_y_url = 'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz'
    train_x = read_image_file(check_exist_or_download(train_x_url)).astype(
        np.float32)
    train_y = read_label_file(check_exist_or_download(train_y_url)).astype(
        np.float32)
    valid_x = read_image_file(check_exist_or_download(valid_x_url)).astype(
        np.float32)
    valid_y = read_label_file(check_exist_or_download(valid_y_url)).astype(
        np.float32)
    return train_x, train_y, valid_x, valid_y


def check_exist_or_download(url):

    download_dir = '/tmp/'

    name = url.rsplit('/', 1)[-1]
    filename = os.path.join(download_dir, name)
    if not os.path.isfile(filename):
        print("Downloading %s" % url)
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)
    return filename


def read_label_file(path):
    with gzip.open(path, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
        assert get_int(data[:4]) == 2049
        length = get_int(data[4:8])
        parsed = np.frombuffer(data, dtype=np.uint8, offset=8).reshape(
            (length))
        return parsed


def get_int(b):
    return int(codecs.encode(b, 'hex'), 16)


def read_image_file(path):
    with gzip.open(path, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
        assert get_int(data[:4]) == 2051
        length = get_int(data[4:8])
        num_rows = get_int(data[8:12])
        num_cols = get_int(data[12:16])
        parsed = np.frombuffer(data, dtype=np.uint8, offset=16).reshape(
            (length, 1, num_rows, num_cols))
        return parsed

def to_categorical(y, num_classes):
    y = np.array(y, dtype="int")
    n = y.shape[0]
    categorical = np.zeros((n, num_classes))
    categorical[np.arange(n), y] = 1
    categorical = categorical.astype(np.float32)
    return categorical

    
# Prepare training and valadiation data
train_x, train_y, test_x, test_y = load_dataset()
IMG_SIZE = 28
num_classes=10    
train_y = to_categorical(train_y, num_classes)
test_y = to_categorical(test_y, num_classes)    

# Normalization
train_x = train_x / 255
test_x = test_x / 255
```

5. Data Partitioning of the Training and Evaluation Datasets


```python
def data_partition(dataset_x, dataset_y, rank_in_global, world_size):
    data_per_rank = dataset_x.shape[0] // world_size
    idx_start = rank_in_global * data_per_rank
    idx_end = (rank_in_global + 1) * data_per_rank
    return dataset_x[idx_start: idx_end], dataset_y[idx_start: idx_end]

train_x, train_y = data_partition(train_x, train_y, sgd.rank_in_global, sgd.world_size)
test_x, test_y = data_partition(test_x, test_y, sgd.rank_in_global, sgd.world_size)
```

6. Configuring the Training Loop Variables


```python
max_epoch = 10
batch_size = 64
tx = tensor.Tensor((batch_size, 1, IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE), dev, tensor.float32)
ty = tensor.Tensor((batch_size, num_classes), dev, tensor.int32)
num_train_batch = train_x.shape[0] // batch_size
num_test_batch = test_x.shape[0] // batch_size
idx = np.arange(train_x.shape[0], dtype=np.int32)
```

7. Initialize and Synchronize the Model Parameters


```python
def sychronize(tensor, dist_opt):
    dist_opt.all_reduce(tensor.data)
    tensor /= dist_opt.world_size

#Sychronize the initial parameter
autograd.training = True
x = np.random.randn(batch_size, 1, IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE).astype(np.float32)
y = np.zeros( shape=(batch_size, num_classes), dtype=np.int32)
tx.copy_from_numpy(x)
ty.copy_from_numpy(y)
out = model.forward(tx)
loss = autograd.softmax_cross_entropy(out, ty)               
for p, g in autograd.backward(loss):
    sychronize(p, sgd)
```

8. Start the Training and Evaluation Loop


```python
# Function to all reduce Accuracy and Loss from Multiple Devices
def reduce_variable(variable, dist_opt, reducer):
    reducer.copy_from_numpy(variable)
    dist_opt.all_reduce(reducer.data)
    dist_opt.wait()
    output=tensor.to_numpy(reducer)
    return output

def accuracy(pred, target):
    y = np.argmax(pred, axis=1)
    t = np.argmax(target, axis=1)
    a = y == t
    return np.array(a, "int").sum()

def augmentation(x, batch_size):
    xpad = np.pad(x, [[0, 0], [0, 0], [4, 4], [4, 4]], 'symmetric')
    for data_num in range(0, batch_size):
        offset = np.random.randint(8, size=2)
        x[data_num,:,:,:] = xpad[data_num, :, offset[0]: offset[0] + 28, offset[1]: offset[1] + 28]
        if_flip = np.random.randint(2)
        if (if_flip):
            x[data_num, :, :, :] = x[data_num, :, :, ::-1]
    return x

# Training and Evaulation Loop
for epoch in range(max_epoch):
    start_time = time.time()
    np.random.shuffle(idx)

    if(sgd.rank_in_global==0):
        print('Starting Epoch %d:' % (epoch))
    
    # Training Phase
    autograd.training = True
    train_correct = np.zeros(shape=[1],dtype=np.float32)
    test_correct = np.zeros(shape=[1],dtype=np.float32)
    train_loss = np.zeros(shape=[1],dtype=np.float32)
    
    for b in range(num_train_batch):
        x = train_x[idx[b * batch_size: (b + 1) * batch_size]]
        x = augmentation(x, batch_size)
        y = train_y[idx[b * batch_size: (b + 1) * batch_size]]
        tx.copy_from_numpy(x)
        ty.copy_from_numpy(y)
        out = model.forward(tx)
        loss = autograd.softmax_cross_entropy(out, ty)               
        train_correct += accuracy(tensor.to_numpy(out), y)
        train_loss += tensor.to_numpy(loss)[0]
        sgd.backward_and_update(loss)

    # Reduce the Evaluation Accuracy and Loss from Multiple Devices
    reducer = tensor.Tensor((1,), dev, tensor.float32)
    train_correct = reduce_variable(train_correct, sgd, reducer)
    train_loss = reduce_variable(train_loss, sgd, reducer)

    # Output the Training Loss and Accuracy
    if(sgd.rank_in_global==0):
        print('Training loss = %f, training accuracy = %f' % 
              (train_loss, train_correct / (num_train_batch*batch_size*sgd.world_size)), flush=True)

    # Evaluation Phase
    autograd.training = False
    for b in range(num_test_batch):
        x = test_x[b * batch_size: (b + 1) * batch_size]
        y = test_y[b * batch_size: (b + 1) * batch_size]
        tx.copy_from_numpy(x)
        ty.copy_from_numpy(y)
        out_test = model.forward(tx)
        test_correct += accuracy(tensor.to_numpy(out_test), y)

    # Reduce the Evaulation Accuracy from Multiple Devices
    test_correct = reduce_variable(test_correct, sgd, reducer)

    # Output the Evaluation Accuracy
    if(sgd.rank_in_global==0):
        print('Evaluation accuracy = %f, Elapsed Time = %fs' % 
              (test_correct / (num_test_batch*batch_size*sgd.world_size), time.time() - start_time ), flush=True)
```

9. Save the above training code in a python file, e.g. mnist_dist_demo.py

10. Generate a hostfile to be used by the MPI, e.g. the hostfile below uses 4 processes and hence 4 GPUs for the training.

```python
cat host_file
```

    localhost:4

11. Finally, use the MPIEXEC command to Execute the Multi-GPUs Training with the hostfile:


```python
mpiexec --hostfile host_file python3 mnist_dist_demo.py
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could result in several times speed up compared to the single GPU training.
```

### II. Using Python multiprocessing

For single node, we can use Python multiprocessing module instead of MPI. It needs just a small portion of code changes:

1. Put all the above training codes in a function, e.g. train_mnist_cnn

2. Generate a NCCIdHolder, define the number of GPUs to be used in the training process (gpu_per_node), and uses the multiprocessing to launch the training code with the arguments.

```python
    # Generate a NCCL ID to be used for collective communication
    nccl_id = singa.NcclIdHolder()

    # Define the number of GPUs to be used in the training process
    gpu_per_node = 8

    # Define and launch the multi-processing
	import multiprocessing
    process = []
    for gpu_num in range(0, gpu_per_node):        
        process.append(multiprocessing.Process(target=train_mnist_cnn, args=(nccl_id, gpu_num, gpu_per_node)))

    for p in process:
        p.start()
```

3. In the training code, it should pass the arguments defined above to the DistOpt object.

```python
sgd = opt.DistOpt(sgd, nccl_id=nccl_id, gpu_num=gpu_num, gpu_per_node=gpu_per_node)

```

4. Finally, we can launch the code with the multiprocessing module.

## Full Examples

The full examples of the distributed training using the MNIST dataset is available in the examples folder of SINGA: (1) MPI: examples/autograd/multi_dist.py and (2) Python Multiprocessing: examples/autograd/mnist_multiprocess.py

## Python DistOpt Methods:

There are a list of methods for distributed training with DistOpt:

1. Create a DistOpt with the SGD object and device assignment:

```python
sgd = opt.SGD(lr=0.005, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=1e-5)
sgd = opt.DistOpt(sgd)
dev = device.create_cuda_gpu_on(sgd.rank_in_local)
```

2. Backward propagation and distributed parameter update:

```python
sgd.backward_and_update(loss)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Input: loss is the objective function of the deep learning model optimization, e.g. for classification problem it can be the output of the softmax_cross_entropy function.

3. Backward propagation and distributed parameter update, using half precision for gradient communication:

```python
sgd.backward_and_update_half(loss)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It converts the gradients to 16 bits half precision format before allreduce

4. Backward propagation and distributed asychronous training with partial parameter synchronization:

```python
backward_and_partial_update(loss)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It performs asychronous training where one parameter partition is all-reduced per iteration.
